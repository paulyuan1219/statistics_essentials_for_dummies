# 2 Descriptive Statistics

# 3 Charts and Graphs

## Categorical Data
- Pie Charts
- Bar Graphs
  - It breaks categorical data down by group
  - often used to compare groups by breaking down the categories for each and showing them as side-by-side bars.
- Time Charts

## Numerical Data
- Histograms
  - it is a bar graph applying to numerical data
  - it provides a snapshot of all the data broken down into numerically ordered groups.
  - it provides a quick way to get the big idea about a numerical data set.
- Boxplots

## How to interpret a histogram or boxplot
- data distribution
  - symmetric
  - skewed right: a lopsided mound with one long tail going off to the right
  - skewed left
- data variability
- data center 


# 4 The Binomial Distribution



# 5 The Normal Distribution
If n is large enough, then we can use a normal distibution to approximate the binomial distribution

The following two conditions must hold
- np >= 10
- n(1-p) >= 10
